  By default it uses all available accelerators, runs an accelerated version
  of the loss layer forward and then updates its weights using the optimizer.
  If only one accelerator is available, this JIT-compiles the underlying
  computation and in this way makes it run faster.

  We assume that both the loss layer (usually model with loss) and the optimizer
  have already been initialized.

  The output after running the `one_step` function is just the loss from the
  loss layer and optimizer statisics but, as a side effect, it also updates
  the weights of the loss layer and the slots of the optimizer.
